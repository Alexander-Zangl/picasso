# Picasso
A collection of tools for painting super-resolution images

## Requirements
### Python 3.* (tested with 3.5)  
I suggest installing it with [Anaconda / Miniconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) which comes bundled with many useful third-party packages and a package manager which removes the pain of building some packages by yourself.

### Python packages
A few third-party Python packages are required. It is recommended to install them via `conda` (add channels if necessary):  
`conda install h5py lmfit matplotlib numba numpy pyqt pyyaml scikit-learn tifffile tqdm`

## Installation
The described procedure is intended for Windows. The equivalent steps for Linux or OSX are not documented.
Replace any `{{...}}` notation according to your situation.
1. Open the console, `cd` to the directory where you want to install and run  
`git clone https://gitlab.com/jungmannlab/picasso.git`  
Alternatively, [download](https://gitlab.com/jungmannlab/picasso) the zip file and unzip it.  
For both options you need approved access on Gitlab.
3. Add `{{picasso directory}}\scripts` to your PATH environment variable.  
This will make the scripts in this folder accessible in the
console, independent of the current directory.
4. Run this command to register the picasso package in the Python installation.
    - `ECHO {{picasso directory}} >> {{python installation directory}}\Lib\site-packages\picasso.pth`
5. Run the PowerShell script "create_shortcuts.ps1" in the top-level directory.  
This should be doable by right-clicking on the script and choosing "Run with PowerShell". Alternatively, run the command `powershell ./create_shortcuts.ps1` in the command line.  
Use the generated shortcuts in the same dirctory to start GUI components.
You can drag these shortcuts to the Desktop, Start Menu or Task Bar.

### Optional steps for your Python environment
* Add `.PY;.PYW` to your `PATHEXT` environment variable.  
The result is that Windows considers these files to be executable, so you don't have to type `.py` or `.pyw` when calling a Python script.
* Depending on your Python installation, Windows might now know that it should call the Python interpreter when running a Python script just by its file name.
If not, run these commands to tell Windows what to do if a `.py` or `.pyw` file is being called:
  - `assoc .py=Python.File`
  - `assoc .pyw=Python.NoConFile`
  - `ftype Python.File=<python installation directory>\python.exe %1 %*`
  - `ftype Python.NoConFile=<python installation directory>\pythonw.exe %1 %*`
