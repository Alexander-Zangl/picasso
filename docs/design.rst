How to use the design module?
-----------------------------

-  Start the design module. A canvas with hexagons, corresponding to the
   flat origami sheet will appear.
-  Design a pattern of DNA-PAINT binding sites by clicking on the
   hexagons.
-  Select a color by clicking on the color palette on the right side.
-  Each color corresponds to a different extension that can be defined
   later.
-  The default state of a hexagon (gray color) indicates that this
   staple will not be extended. Click on the “Clear”-Button to reset all
   hexagons.
-  Click on “Extensions” to define the sequence for each extension.
-  Use “Get plates” to get an excel sheet with all needed sequences in a
   plate format.
-  Use “Pipetting scheme” and select the folder with your plate list to
   generate a pipetting scheme.
-  Use “Folding scheme” to get a table for pipetting folding mixes

FAQ
---

-  What does the V symbol, which appears on some hexagons after
   coloring, indicate? While usually all 3’-ends of each staple point
   upwards the staple routing on hexagons with a V marking is pointing
   downwards.
