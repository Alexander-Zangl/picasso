sx ,The Point Spread Function width in camera pixels ,float 
sy ,The Point Spread Function height in camera pixels ,float 
bg ,"The number of background photons per pixel, not including the camera offset ",float 
lpx ,"The localization precision in x direction, in camera pixels, as estimated by the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound of the Maximum Likelihood fit. ",float 
lpy ,"The localization precision in y direction, in camera pixels, as estimated by the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound of the Maximum Likelihood fit. ",float 
net_gradient ,"The net gradient of this spot which is defined by the sum of gradient vector magnitudes within the fix box, projected to the spot center. ",float 
likelihood ,The log-likelihood of the fit ,float 
iterations ,The number of iterations of the fit procedure ,long 
group ,"(Optional) An identifier to assign multiple localizations to groups, for example by picking regions of interest ",long 
len ,"(Optional) The length of the event, if localizations from consecutive frames have been linked ",long 
n ,"(Optional) The number of localizations in this event, if localizations from consecutive frames have been linked, potentially diverging from the “len” column due to a transient dark time tolerance ",long 
photon_rate ,"(Optional) The mean number of photons per frame, if localizations from consecutive frames have been linked. The total number of photons is set in the “photons” column. ",float
